#  ARNewspaper

Simple project working with ARKit (SceneKit and SpriteKit) to create a "magic newspaper" as seen in Harry Potter movies.  The app detects certain images on a newspaper in the real world and projects audio/video onto the image, bringing it to life.

No ownership claimed over images from Harry Potter.  Not for distribute, sale or license.

The video is not included with this repo. In order to get it to work, will need to get a video in .mp4 format (480p) and save it to /ARNewspaper file with the name "PotterImage.mp4".
